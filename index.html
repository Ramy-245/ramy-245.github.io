    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I would say my key structure is the tubing. I say this because my tubing lowers the water from the funnel to the spout and has a split on the top quarter of the tube which brings that water to a bucket taped to the bottom of the box and then also leads to the spout with the original tube to get randomized results. </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>There is this unknown object called the Mystery Black Box and it has a funnel at the top of the Mystery Black Box and a tube at the bottom. Whenever you pour water in sometimes none, more, or less comes out. We poured in 500ML and none came out. We poured another 500ML and 110ML came out so it's completely random. I will never know 100% what's inside but I could guess because I made a model to try to get results like the Black Box.</p>
  
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <h3>Reasoning Part I</h3>
    <p>Model: A model is like me building a replica based on what I think the initial product looks like. </p>
    <h3>Reasoning Part II</h3>
    <p>The tubing lets all water go from one point to another and has a pit stop making it random. </p>
    <h3>Reasoning Part III</h3>
    <p>If there wasn't any tubing ordifferent tubing the water would have been slower faster or would flow in bigger chunks.</p>
